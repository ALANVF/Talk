# functions can be declared different ways, but they do the same thing

method add takes $a, $b
	return $a + $b
end

$minus [$a, $b]
	return $a - $b
end

$times takes $a, $b
	return $a * $b
end

method divide [$a, $b]
	return $a / $b
end

-/ btw

method a And return 1
also method b And return 2
end

-means-

method a And return 1
end
method b And return 2
end

(`also method b` can also be `&b`)
